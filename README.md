# React Gallery App

An application that fetches data from the flickr API and displays images according to user input.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Styles changes
* Added color changes to the app by using `:root {}` and using the variables inside. 
* Made images expand out when hovering over the image component


## Starting the application
* Install node modules by running `npm install` in the directory terminal
* Create a `config.js` file in the **src** folder and add flickr API key with `apiKey` as it's variable. Then, export the key.
* Start the application by running `npm start` in the directory terminal
